		    <h1>Nikola Tesla</h1>

		    <div class="sub1">
		      Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American engineer and inventor who is highly regarded in energy history for his development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems. He also made extraordinary contributions in the fields of electromagnetism and wireless radio communications.

		      <br><br>
		        Tesla's discoveries were used to build the first hydro-electric power plant in 1895 in Niagara Falls, NY and started the electrification of the world!

		    </div>

		    <div class="txt1">
		      There are a minimum of 278 patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries that have been accounted for. Many of Tesla's patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe.

		      <div  class="txt1">Some of Tesla's inventions and patents:
